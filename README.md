# Odin's landing page project

A simple landing page built following a design provided by TheOdinProject.

This project is part of the Foundations section of The Odin Project curriculum. I made slight changes to the information section of the original design, adapting it to a fictional web design agency.

Original design to replicate:

<img src="./images/Odin&apos;s landing page design.png" width=500 height=auto>

The page is not responsive and lacks real functionality. The object of this project was to practice using Flexbox and other CSS concepts covered in the previous lessons of The Odin Project curriculum.
